# SPADA
Code for SPADA lab genomics research. The simulations module implements a joint bulk and scRNA-seq data simulation based on the URSM (https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1520564486) and ZIFA (https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0805-z) models. The HypothesisTesting module allows users to test whether bulk and single-cell datasets come from the same source, including a p-value under the null hypothesis that the datasets are unrelated.

The Preprocessing folder contains C++ code for handling datasets stored in csv and tsv files.
